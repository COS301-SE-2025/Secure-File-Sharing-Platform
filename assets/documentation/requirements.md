## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Secure File Sharing Platform system.

-----

## Functional Requirements

The Secure File Sharing platform shall (Version 1):

### FR1. User Authentication & Account Management
    
1.1 Users shall be able to register an account with a secure password.

1.2 Users shall be able to log in using registered credentials.

1.3 The system shall support multi-factor authentication.

1.4 The system shall support third-party authentication.

1.5 Users shall be able to reset passwords securely.

1.6 The system shall enforce account lockout after multiple failed login attempts.

### FR2. File Upload and Download

2.1 Users shall be able to upload files to the platform.

2.2 Users shall be able to download files from the platform.

2.3 The system shall display upload/download progress with cancel support.

### FR3. End-to-End File Encryption

3.1 Files shall be encrypted on the client side before upload.

3.2 Files shall be decrypted on the client side after download.

3.3 Only the sender and intended recipient(s) shall have access to encryption keys.

### FR4. File Sharing and Access Control

4.1 Users shall be able to share files with specific users.

4.2 The sender shall be able to set permissions:
 - view-only (cannot download)
 - Download-only (cannot preview online)
 - Full access (view + download)

4.3 The sender shall be able to revoke access at any time.

### FR5. Digital Signing

5.1 Users shall be able to digitally sign files.

### FR6. Access Logs and Audit Trails

6.1 All file-related events (upload, view, share, download) shall be logged.

6.2 Authorized users and administrators shall be able to view access logs.

6.3 Each log entry shall record time, user, and action type.

### FR7. Advanced Sharing Options

7.1 Files shall be shareable with one-time download links.

7.2 Users shall be able to set file expiration times.

7.3 Sharing with multiple recipients simultaneously shall be supported.

### FR8. Administrative Controls

8.1 Administrators shall be able to monitor all user and file activity logs.

8.2 Administrators shall be able to manage user accounts:
- Remove user accounts
- Restrict accounts for policy violations

### FR9. Notifications

9.1 The system shall send push/email notifications on key events.

### FR10. File Organization

10.1 Users shall be able to create and organize folders.
10.2 The system shall support file renaming, moving, and deletion.

### FR11. Error Handling/Detection

11.1 The system shall display meaningful error messages for failed operations.
11.2 The system shall validate input fields.

### FR12. Key Management

12.1 The system shall generate key pairs for each user.
12.2 Only public keys shall be stored on the server.

### FR13. Cloud Storage Integration

13.1 The system shall use open-source cloud infrastructure for backend file management.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1. User Authentication & Account Management

  * **NFR1.1**: All user credentials must be encrypted using industry standard algorithms.
  * **NFR1.2**: Multi-factor authentication must be enforced where configured.
  * **NFR1.3**: Authentication endpoints must be resilient to brute force attacks.
  * **NFR1.4**: Password reset tokens must expire within 15 minutes.

### NFR2. File Upload and Download

  * **NFR2.1**: Progress indicators must update in real-time (less than 500 ms delay).
  * **NFR2.2**: Cancel operations must terminate transfers within 2 seconds.

### NFR3. End-to-End File Encryption

  * **NFR3.1**: Encryption algorithms must use AES-256 for symmetric encryption and RSA-4096 or ECC for asymmetric operations.
  * **NFR3.2**: No unencrypted file or key material shall be stored on the server.
  * **NFR3.3**: Compliance with GDPR and other regional data protection regulations is mandatory.

### NFR4. File Sharing and Access Control

  * **NFR4.1**: Permissions shall be enforced at the backend and shall not be bypassable via client modifications.
  * **NFR4.2**: The user interface must visually distinguish between different permission levels clearly.

### NFR5. Digital Signing

  * **NFR5.1**: Signing operations must comply with digital signature standards.
  * **NFR5.2**: Digital signature verification must be deterministic and complete within 1 second.

### NFR6. Access Logs and Audit Trails

  * **NFR6.1**: Log entries must be immutable and tamper proof.
  * **NFR6.2**: Logs must be retained for a minimum of 1 year.

### NFR7. Advanced Sharing Options

  * **NFR7.1**: One time links must expire automatically after download or expiration time, whichever comes first.
  * **NFR7.2**: Expired links must be purged within 1 hour of expiration.

### NFR8. Administrative Controls

  * **NFR8.1**: Administrator actions must be auditable and traceable.
  * **NFR8.2**: Administrative interfaces must be restricted to authenticated and authorized users only.

### NFR9. Notifications

  * **NFR9.1**: Notification delivery (email/push) must occur within 30 seconds of the triggering event.
  * **NFR9.2**: The system must use secure protocols (TLS, HTTPS) for sending notifications.

### NFR10. Error Handling/Detection

  * **NFR11.1**: All error messages must be user friendly, localizable, and provide actionable guidance.
  * **NFR11.2**: The system must log all critical and warning-level errors with full context for debugging.

### NFR11. Key Management

  * **NFR12.1**: Keys must be generated using a secure random number generator (e.g., WebCrypto).
  * **NFR12.2**: The system must ensure zero exposure of private keys to the server.
