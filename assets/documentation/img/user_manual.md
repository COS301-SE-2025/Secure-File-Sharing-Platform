# Introduction

Welcome to SecureShare, a platform that aims for secure, end-to-end encrypted file sharing.

## What is SecureShare?

Secure Share is a cloud-based file-sharing platform developed to protect user privacy through end-to-end encryption (E2EE). Unlike traditional platforms like Google Drive or Dropbox, which store files in an accessible format on the cloud, Secure Share ensures that only the intended sender and recipient can view the contents of a shared file.

This platform encrypts files before they are uploaded, and they are only decrypted after download by an authorized recipient. The encryption process uses industry-standard cryptographic techniques such as AES for file encryption and RSA/X3DH for secure key exchanges.

Secure Share was developed with the vision of providing a privacy-focused, secure, and user-friendly file-sharing experience for a wide range of users—from businesses and developers to journalists and privacy-conscious individuals. Whether you're sharing sensitive documents, private media, or secure contracts, SecureShare keeps your data in your hands—and out of reach from third parties.
